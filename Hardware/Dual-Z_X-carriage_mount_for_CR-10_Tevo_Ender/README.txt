# Summary

I designed these X-Carriage mount for a friend of mine and his CR-10 dual-Z, belt driven setup.

The main features of this project are:
- it's **compatible with anti backlash nuts** but you can even use the **stock nuts**
- **reduce zwobble**: these mounts have some little slinding area where the leadscrew nuts can adjust their position and **fine tune**. For the same reason it also **reduce noises**
- leascrew can be installed both ways, with **motors on top or bottom**. Because of it there are two different models you can print: with *nuts on top* or *nuts on bottom*.
- you can use the **stock feeder** or even a **bondtech BMG** without any changes and  the **overall print height is unaffected**
- it's **solid** but **minimal** at the same time so you will need **very little filament** to print these models
- it's **easy to print** because it does **not require any support**
- it's even **compatible with dual extruder** setups if you mirror the left motor mount in your slicer. Likewise is **compatible with direct-drive** setups if you mirror the right mount and print two brackets without motor support

At the moment is successfully installed on my friend's **CR10-mini printer** but since it's actually similar to Creality and Tevo other models setup we think you can install even of those printers. 

Let us know if you succeed or not! 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: CR-10 Mini
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 25% triangles
Filament_brand: formfutura
Filament_color: black transparent
Filament_material: PETG

Notes: 
**PETG** (or even better **PBT**!) is the best filament choice for this kind of application.
Printed with **3 perimeters, 0.2mm layers, 0.4 nozzle, 5 top/bottom, 25% infill triangles, no supports**

# Post-Printing

## Hardware required

For the **Left mount** you will need

| qty | item | notes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3x | m5 hex nuts | (from existing mount) |
| 2x | m3X10 button head hex drive screws | (from existing mount) |
| 2x | m3 hex nuts | (from existing mount) |

--- 

For the **Right mount** you will need

| qty | item | notes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3x | m5 hex nuts | (from existing mount) |
| 2x | m3X10 button head hex drive screws | (from existing mount) |
| 2x | m3 hex nuts | (from existing mount) |
| 3x | 8mm spacer | (from existing dual mount setup, add otherwise) |
| 3x | m5x40 socket head screws | (from existing dual mount setup, add otherwise) |


*Notice:* this in the minimal required hardare! 
Since BeaverUP is (almost) setup agnostic add other hardware as required: for example you may need to add a second leadscrew, anti-backlash or stock nuts, and so on!
