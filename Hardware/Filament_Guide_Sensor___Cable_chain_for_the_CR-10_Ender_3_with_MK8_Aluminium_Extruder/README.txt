# Summary

I really like the chito's design but didn't really need the sponge cleaning capability + wanted to still have the ability to attach cable chain using yannicked's adapter. So I designed this. It's designed around the cheap mechanical switch from aliexpress that comes with it's own enclosure, pulled out of it's enclosure (I believe it's actually the same EZOut uses).

It uses PTFE tube (I used the spare white one that came with my printer) pushed through the whole enclosure with just a small piece cut out to allow the mechanical switch to work. The holes are pretty tight so I suggest to push the tube through the assembly and after that cut the hole in place. If done right it even moves both directions which enables the M600 marlin command to push the fillament out for an easy change.

There are 2 versions, one with M10 thread which is used for the PTFE tube coupler and one without so you can just push piece of PTFE tube through it. 

To attach the base with cable chain clips to the printer use the default set of screws. To attach top case to the fillament runout sensor case you need 2x 3M 6mm screws. To attach the whole assembly to the base you need 2x 3M 8mm screws.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: Ender 3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 25
Filament_brand: Gembird
Filament_color: White
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
Top/Bottom layers: 4
Walls: 3

Print the top cover upside down, there's thin layer covering the screw holes so it can be printed without supports, use really anything to puncture that thin layer after print finishes. Print the base with cable chain clips as shown in the image above, so the layers are perpendicular to the way cable chain is attached and it doesn't break.
